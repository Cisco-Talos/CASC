## CASC
The ClamAV Signature Creator (CASC), is an IDA Pro plug-in to aid reverse 
engineers in creating ClamAV NDB and LDB signatures from IDA Pro's Disassembly 
or Strings view.

CASC should run on any platform that supports IDA Pro 6.7 and higher.
Limited functionality is available for IDA Pro 6.6

## Installation

The ClamAV Signature Creator (CASC) is easy to install. Simply copy and paste 
the Python script (`clamav_sig_creator.py`) to IDA Pro’s plug-in directory


| Operating System               | IDA Pro Plug-in Path                     |
| ------------------------------ | -----------------------------------------|
| Windows XP (x86)               | `C:\Program Files\IDA 6.7\plugins\`        |
| Windows Vista and higher (x64) | `C:\Program Files (x86)\IDA 6.7\plugins\`  |
| Linux                          | `<ida_install_dir>/plug-ins `              |

## Support Information

ClamAV Signature Creator (CASC) is meant for creating ClamAV signatures on the
sample as it exists on disk. Sub signatures could be based off unpacked code
during the sample’s execution, however, ClamAV would not be able to match those
signatures (some exception exist for automatic unpackers built into ClamAV).

Opening Plug-in
===============
Once the Python script is copied to the IDA Pro plug-ins folder, open IDA Pro 
with a sample. There are two ways of opening the plug-in.

 -  IDA Pro’s Plug-in Menu (Edit -> Plugins -> ClamAV Signature Creator
 -  Press \` (backtick)

Once the plug-in is opened you will be able to view sub signatures created in 
the past and saved in the IDB, add new misc ClamAV sub signatures, and add sub 
signatures generated from disassembly selected in the IDB.

## Creating Sub Signatures

Sub signatures can either be created from disassembly viewable from within IDA 
Pro or manually from entering/creating a valid ClamAV sub signature.

### Insert Misc. Sub Signature

A custom ClamAV sub signature can be created in a couple of different ways:
 -  Within the CASC plug-in window, press the Ins key
 -  Within the CASC plug-in window, right click and select "Insert"
 -  Within the Strings window; select the string(s) of interest, right click, 
    and select "Add string to ClamAV Signature Creator"

### Insert Assembly Sub Signature

There are several ways to create a sub signature from disassembly within the 
IDB. All methods involve first selecting the code you are interested in 
creating a signature from. Either highlight the code or position and click your 
cursor in the basic block of interest, then:

- Within the CASC plug-in window, press Ctrl+Ins
- Within the CASC plug-in window, right click and select "Insert Assembly"
 -  Within the IDA View window by
     *  Pressing Ctrl+\`
     *  Right click and select "Add Assembly to ClamAV Sig Creator…"

The Assembly to Signature window will allow you to insert notes for the sub 
signature, apply various masking options, and scroll through the 
opcodes/assembly associated with that sub signature.

Selecting a masking option will change the opcodes and assembly text if the 
masking option can be applied. Selecting "Customize" will allow you to edit the
opcodes (note the assembly area will not update for any customizations made). 
If you uncheck “Customize” then all previously applied masking options will be 
applied and the customizations will be deleted.

## Common Problems
If a masking option is selected but the opcodes and assembly don’t change:

	ESP Offsets
        This will apply to [esp+offset] operands only
	EBP Offsets
        This will apply to [ebp+offset] operands only

### Absolute Calls
IDA might display the disassembly as 
    
`call      memset`

However, that instruction may be a call to a function within the sample 
    that directly calls or jumps to the actual memset function. If that is the 
    case, no changes will be made.
Global Offsets

    [https://github.com/vrtadmin/casc/issues](https://github.com/vrtadmin/casc/issues)

### Editing Sub Signatures

To edit a signature, simply double click on the signature within the CASC 
plug-in window and the signature will open up for editing. Any changes made 
will be saved only if you press OK. Prior to saving a sub signature it will 
undergo a verification to ensure it correctly conforms to a ClamAV signature 
component. If any problems exist, clicking the OK but will result in an error 
message to its right. The error must be corrected before the sub signature will
be saved.

## Creating ClamAV Signature

Before creating a signature, make sure to give it a descriptive ClamAV 
signature name (the default is Win.Trojan.Agent). Once a sub signature(s) is 
created, you can select one or more sub signatures from the CASC plug-in window
(use Ctrl or Shift keys to select multiple signatures) and click the 
"Create ClamAV Signature"

Once the “Create ClamAV Signature” button is click a dialog box with a 
formatted email will be displayed for the user to send to ClamAV’s 
community-sigs list. Selecting the [community-sigs@lists.clamav.net](community-sigs@lists.clamav.net) hyperlink  is a mailto: link. It will attempt to copy the signature information displayed  to the systems default mail client. Keep in mind if any special characters are  used then the email’s contents may not be correct and will need to be manually  copied over.
